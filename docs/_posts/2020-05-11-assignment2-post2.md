### Storyboard

Grandpa comes home, but he accidentally drops his key under the sofa. He tries to reach it using 
his cane, but cannot do it. His back also hurts from bending over too much. This is where Cozmo comes to rescue. Grandpa puts Cozmo down. Cozmo goes under the sofa, finds the key and brings it back. 


### Sketch

We attach a flashlight to Cozmo, so it is able to navigate in the dark. The lift is also modified to push 
various objects, like keys. Cozmo built-in carema is used for perception and navigation. Cozmo will be small
enough to fit under furniture, in this case, a sofa.
