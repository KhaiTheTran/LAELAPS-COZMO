### What we adopted

From our assignment 1 strategies, we used Slack and Google docs. 
We also used Github Pull Requests and had weekly Zoom meetings. 
In general, Slack and Google docs worked well. We are able to collaborate 
on Google docs, and post it on our website after it’s finalized. 
It was good that everyone met at the scheduled time for Zoom, and doing 
group assignments over Zoom made them go a lot faster and more efficiently. 

Initially, each team member was assigned a role. Instead of fixing the 
roles, we adopted a strategy where we split the project into three parts -- 
perception, navigation and manipulation, and we each are responsible for 
one part. This worked out well, because it’s clear what we need to implement 
and what our responsibilities are. 

### What didn’t work
Pull Requests weren’t really necessary for this project, because the code was small, 
and many of us didn't have time to look at each other's code in detail.
