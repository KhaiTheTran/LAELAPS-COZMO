Strategies:

Proper communication is one of the most important strategies we will utilize. The main tools we are using to do this are
a team slack channel where we will be posting our weekly meeting times and where we should ask questions if we get stuck.
In addition we will be creating shared google docs to collaborate on written assignments, and  for creating team documents
such as the Team Vision and weekly goals. Also, if we feel the need to try things like pair programming we can try using
tools like VSCode Live Share. Since we may want to try multiple roles, we will allow for rotation between roles so everyone
will at least get the chance to work on what they want. When coding we will make sure that it is properly documented, so 
that it will be easy for our teammates to understand and they can build on top of it more easily. If there is any confusion,
or improper documentation, we will make sure to explain the code and document it properly. We will use pull requests that
everyone should review before merging, to try to minimize the possibility of bugs popping up in our code. Each week we will
have a meeting where we will discuss what we got done that week, the problems we had, what we can do better going forward,
and our goals for the upcoming week. Lastly we will make sure that we interview a few people, and possibly conduct surveys
to make sure our product is aligned with what consumers actually want.
